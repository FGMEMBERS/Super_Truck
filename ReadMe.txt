Thank you for reading this.  It will bring you up to speed faster than just driving the truck.

Since no one reads the Authors file, you should know the following:

Credits:
The Crash_Hauler, Crash_hauler_long, and the Crash_camaro are all products of a FDM created by Anders Gidenstam for his Crash_tender.  The Super_Truck FDM is based upon the same original creation by Anders Gidenstam, but with even more changes than the _haulers.  Without it these vehicles would not exist.

- Additional thanks:
	Dave Culp for Drag Chutes and Beacons in the Davepack.
	Gary Neeley for his continued education of novice FG users such as myself.
	Lanny Chambers for his extensive testing, feedback, and understanding my frustration when MP features don't work.


Requirements:
	- Must have "Davepack" installed, from David Culp's website (http://members.cox.net/davidculp/hangar.html)

**************** MUST READ ******************

General:
	Like the _haulers, this truck has plenty of power, and very little drag.
	This requires conservative use of the throttle, ample brake use, and most importantly SMALL steering inputs.

	I have designed this vehicles with numerous devices and specifications to promote stability and control recovery.
	This does not mean you can operate at the limits without crashing hard.

Crashes:
	JSBsim has issues when interacting with different surface faces, and will result in extremely hard crashes that may freeze FlightGear.
	After a crash, do not attempt to "reset", simply close or force quit FlightGear and restart.

Jumping:
	One of the enjoyable parts of the FDM is its terrain-climbing and terrain-jumping abilities.  These truck will leap and bound like no tomorrow.  But, this will also lead to unrecoverable crashes.  A little driving will show you the proper amount, but in general always apply brakes or move throttle to zero just before leaving the ground surface. This will help ensure an "arc" flightpath back to mother earth.
	You want to always attempt to land nose down or flat. Tail down landings are discouraged.
	In general, always release brakes before landing.
		*Note: Brakes cuts engine thrust AND applies brakes
	If you find the vehicle attitude too far nose down while in the air, adding throttle will bring the nose up.
		*But conversely, removing throttle will _not_ bring the nose down.
	Again, best to always apply brakes and remove power while jumping.

Specific jumping:
	If you get into it, you may find it fun to set up jump ramps at different locations.
	I have a pre-made jump (modified from the original in FG/Models) set at KSFO, which allows you to jump up onto the Air-Train track that moves in around the terminal.  If you would like the location send me an email.

Rock-Climbing:
	Due to the impressive JSBsim FDM, you will find the truck will climb extreme objects.  For example, you can drive up on top of all three large hangars at Moffett Field.
	Take it slow or you'll jump right off the other side, and laugh all the way to the ground.
	You can cross the bridges, and solid bridges you'll find yourself driving over the top framework.

Recovery Devices:
	Anytime you find yourself approaching ground in a bad attitude, or starting to spin in the air, I recommend doing two things.
	1) Pull the ripcord!
		*All my vehicles have ballistic drag chutes to enhance survival.
		90% of the time they will enable you to survive the crash and drive away.  The remainder, well, sorry!
		Ripcord is "d". Chute jettison is "j"

	2) Apply BRAKES!
		As mentioned above, Applying brakes will cut all thrust. 
		This is very important, as thrust is the enemy during a crash.
		Always apply brakes until safely stopped on the ground.
